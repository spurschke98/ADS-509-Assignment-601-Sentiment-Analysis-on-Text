    "- Perfection: This song right away doesn't look as positive to me as the previous, but it does have many positive words such as perfection, baby, best, and winner. \n",
    "- I Found You Love: Once again, cher over uses the words baby and love, leading to a positive sentiment of this song. This in my opinion is more positive than Love and Understanding and Perfection, based on how the sentences are constructed. However this sentiment calculation only considers the presence of the words not the combination of them. \n"
